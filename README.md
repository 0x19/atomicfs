# AtomicFS

Decentralized General Storage Protocol.

Basically, I'd like to build the blockchain database for storage. Similar ideas are Swarn or IPFS. I'm targeting from following practice to obtain a deeper understanding into blockchain protocol internals.

This is a proof of concept, study of my own. 

**NOT FOR A PRODUCTION USE. NOT FOR ANY SORT OF USE RIGHT NOW.**

Eventually, once built to any sane level will make notice here and change the project scope of use.
